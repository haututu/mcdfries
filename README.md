# Overview

After studying Bayesian analysis I was looking for an easy example to test out. 
This analysis investigates the weight of MacDonalds fries using data from other countries as priors.
It is also a simple to follow example using BEST. To follow what I have done look at the `html` file in this repository.

# Data

The `csv` files have data from each country I could find data on. Variables are fairly self explanatory with the exception of pack, which is a three point scale for the visual estimate on how packed the fries looked. This variable isnt considered but could be interesting if there were enough data points.
